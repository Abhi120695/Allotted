Allotted, the name says it all. An application designed to save the tiresome manual labour of VIT's clubs/chapters members to look through members timetables and generate a schedule of those members free to get a task done. The application after a one-time oversimplification database entry, will retrieve the list of all members free on a given day at a particular time frame. The database is easy to update and manage with import and export features as well. Let's get to work. Chop chop.
